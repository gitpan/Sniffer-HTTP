=head1 NAME

Sniffer::Connection::HTTP - Callbacks for a HTTP connection

=head1 SYNOPSIS

You shouldn't use this directly but via L<Sniffer::HTTP>
which encapsulates most of this.

  my $sniffer = Sniffer::Connection::HTTP->new(
    callbacks => {
      request  => sub { my ($req,$conn) = @_; print $req->uri,"\n" if $req },
      response => sub { my ($res,$req,$conn) = @_; print $res->code,"\n" },
    }
  );

  # retrieve TCP packet in $tcp, for example via Net::Pcap
  my $tcp = sniff_tcp_packet;

  $sniffer->handle_packet($tcp);

=head1 TODO

=over 4

=item *

Think about pipelined connections. These are not easily massaged into the
request/response scheme. Well, maybe they are, with a bit of hidden
logic here.

=item *

Every response accumulates all data in memory instead of
giving the user the partial response so it can be written
to disk. This should maybe later be improved.

=back

=head1 BUGS

The whole module suite has almost no tests.

If you experience problems, I<please> supply me with a complete,
relevant packet dump as the included C<dump-raw.pl> creates. Even
better, supply me with (failing) tests.
