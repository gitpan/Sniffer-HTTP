=head1 NAME

Sniffer::HTTP - multi-connection sniffer driver

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $VERBOSE = 0;

  my $sniffer = Sniffer::HTTP->new(
    callbacks => {
      request  => sub { my ($req,$conn) = @_; print $req->uri,"\n" if $req },
      response => sub { my ($res,$req,$conn) = @_; print $res->code,"\n" },
      log      => sub { print $_[0] if $VERBOSE },
      tcp_log  => sub { print $_[0] if $VERBOSE > 1 },
    }
  );

  $sniffer->run('eth0'); # loops forever

  # Or, if you want to feed it the packets yourself:

  while (1) {

    # retrieve TCP packet into $tcp, for example via Net::Pcap
    my $eth = sniff_ethernet_packet;

    # And handle the packet. Callbacks will be invoked as soon
    # as complete data is available
    $sniffer->handle_eth_packet($eth);
  };

This driver gives you callbacks with the completely accumulated
L<HTTP::Request>s or L<HTTP::Response>s as sniffed from the
TCP traffic. You need to feed it the Ethernet, IP or TCP packets
either from a dump file or from L<Net::Pcap> by unpacking them via
L<NetPacket>.

As the whole response data is accumulated in memory you should
be aware of memory issues. If you want to write stuff
directly to disk, you will need to submit patches to L<Sniffer::Connection::HTTP>.

A good example to start from is the C<live-http-headers.pl>
script that comes with the distribution.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<< new %ARGS >>

Creates a new object for handling many HTTP requests.
You can pass in the following arguments:

  connections - preexisting connections (optional)
  callbacks   - callbacks for the new connections (hash reference)

Usually, you will want to create a new object like this:

  my $sniffer = Sniffer::HTTP->new( callbacks => {
    request  => sub { my ($req, $conn) = @_; print $req->uri,"\n"; },
    response => sub { my ($res,$req,$conn) = @_; print $res->code,"\n"; },
  });

except that you will likely do more work than this example.

=head2 C<< $sniffer->find_or_create_connection TCP, %ARGS >>

This parses a TCP packet and creates the TCP connection
to keep track of the packet order and resent packets.

=head2 C<< $sniffer->handle_eth_packet ETH >>

Processes a raw ethernet packet. L<Net::PCap> will return
this kind of packet for most Ethernet network cards.

You need to call this method (or one of the other protocol
methods) for every packet you wish to handle.

  my ($self,$eth) = @_;

Processes a raw ip packet.

  $self->handle_tcp_packet(NetPacket::IP->decode($ip)->{data});

=head2 C<< $sniffer->handle_tcp_packet TCP >>

Processes a raw tcp packet. This processes the packet
by handing it off to the L<Sniffer::Connection> which handles
the reordering of TCP packets.

  my ($self,$tcp) = @_;

=head2 C<< run DEVICE, PCAP_FILTER >>

Listens on the given device for all TCP
traffic from and to port 80 and invokes the callbacks
as necessary. If you want finer control
over what C<Net::Pcap> does, you need to set up
Net::Pcap yourself.

On Linux, you can give the device name 'any' and it
will listen on all interfaces.

On Windows, you can give a regular expression and it
will listen on the device whose name matches that
regular expression.

=head1 BUGS

The whole module suite has almost no tests.

If you experience problems, I<please> supply me with a complete,
relevant packet dump as the included C<dump-raw.pl> creates. Even
better, supply me with (failing) tests.
