v0.05 - Added much documentation and clarifications thanks to (in no order)
         theorbtwo, blokhead, Bart Lateur, 
      - Added live-http-headers.pl example script
      - Added methods to handle Ethernet and IP packets
      - Renamed handle_packet to handle_tcp_packet
      - handle_tcp_packet now accepts both, a raw TCP frame
        or a NetPacket::TCP hash
      - The demo script live-http-headers.pl has better/saner defaults
      - The test script dump-raw.pl has better/saner defaults
      - added simplicistic ->run method that tries to use sane defaults
      - Net::Pcap is now a prerequisite
 		  
v0.04 - Fixed the out-of-order TCP problem for now
      - added some first semblance of a test suite

v0.03 - some public release
