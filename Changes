outstanding for later:

Net::Pcap::FindDevice:
    - Spin off as a separate distribution

Sniffer::HTTP
    - implement multiple outstanding requests/responses for one connection
    - find out why it doesn't listen on just port 80

v0.21 (20110327):
      - Fix loop behaviour in Sniffer::HTTP::flush_window to process more
        than one packet
      . Add synopsis to dump-raw.pl
      . Fix tests, again

v0.20 (20110322):
      - POD fixes
      - Reduced default value for snaplen libpcap parameter
      - Made snaplen parameter configurable, after discussion in
        http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=894262

v0.19 (20090215):
      - Sniffer::HTTP: src_port and dst_port are now initialized from the
        first packet if they are yet unset

v0.18 (20081109):
      - Bail out of testing if no device is found by Net::Pcap
      . Only test changes, no upgrade necessary.

v0.17 (20070113):
      - James Mastros suggested skipping more tests if not
        running as root on non-Win32 platforms. The tests now
	output a warning if you are not on Win32 and $> is nonzero.
	The tests will still be run but likely you need to execute
	them using

	    sudo make test

	to get results unobstructed by permissions. This
	affects
	    t/01-find-device.t
	    t/05-dump-to-file.t

v0.16 (20060918):
      - Fixed a typo in the synopsis of HTTP::Sniffer
      - POD fixes
      - "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" is now case insensitive, thanks to
        Andre Nurwono
      - Fix t/05-dump-to-file.t to gracefully fail if the user
        cannot sniff due to (likely) permission problems.

v0.15 (20060605):
      - Added the missing File::Slurp prerequisite, found by Joshua Ben Jore
      - No code/functionality changes

v0.14 (20060426):
      - Fixed a bug where too much data was parsed, thanks to Karl Pietri
        for the report and capture file

v0.13 (200602xx):
      - added missing dependency on Exporter::Lite (reported by J. Jore)
      - added prerequisite of libpcap of at least 0.8
      - fixed stupid error that never let you specify an interface
      - disabled the 'any' device as it returns frames in a format
        that is different from Ethernet frames (and the libpcap
        documentation is opaque to me in that regard)

v0.12 (20051112):
      - live-http-headers.pl now also outputs the status message
        of the response.
      - dropped support for v0.04 of Net::Pcap, as there is a
        PPM for Net::Pcap v0.09 on uwinnipeg now:
          Perl 5.6: http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppmpackages
          Perl 5.8: http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms

v0.11 (20051107):
      - Refactored code out into Net::Pcap::FindDevice which
        will soon begin a life of its own in a separate distribution
        (thanks to Bart Lateur and James Mastros)
      - You can specify a device by IP and not just by name or description.
        (suggested by Bart Lateur)
      - The live-capture test t/05 now has an alarm() to kill
        itself if it takes over 60 seconds.

v0.10 (20051106):
      - Staleness calbacks didn't work at all. Fixed now.

v0.09 (20051106):
      - added timeout to Sniffer::HTTP
      - added stale connection detection to Sniffer::HTTP
      - added last_activity to Sniffer::Connection
      - added timestamp handling from Net::Pcap so even
        captures play back with the correct timestamps
      - add "Tee to file" capability to ->run() under the
        option name "capture_file"

v0.08 (20051104):
      - Make magic less OS dependent:
        * qr// checks against keys and values, regardless of OS
      - guard against ->run(qr//), ->run(undef), ->run("") - these are
        handled gracefully
      - Make request absolute from Host: header
      - Reading from libpcap capture files works, even with filters
      - Add (example of) reading from an ethereal capture (see t/03*)
      - Fixed partially borked handling of Transfer-Encoding: chunked
      - Find and remember port number from TCP packets
          and put it in the request (faked via Host: header)

v0.07 (20051103)
      - Added Pcap example filters
      - added much more magic to select a suitable interface
        to listen on. See find_device().

v0.06 (200510xx)
      - Fixed crash if Sniffer::HTTP object is created without a log()
        callback.
      - The Pcap filter parameter was not used at all...

v0.05 (200510xx)
      - Added much documentation and clarifications thanks to (in no order)
         theorbtwo, blokhead, Bart Lateur,
      - Added live-http-headers.pl example script
      - Added methods to handle Ethernet and IP packets
      - Renamed handle_packet to handle_tcp_packet
      - handle_tcp_packet now accepts both, a raw TCP frame
        or a NetPacket::TCP hash
      - The demo script live-http-headers.pl has better/saner defaults
      - The test script dump-raw.pl has better/saner defaults
      - added simplicistic ->run method that tries to use sane defaults
      - Net::Pcap is now a prerequisite

v0.04 (200510xx)
      - Fixed the out-of-order TCP problem for now
      - added some first semblance of a test suite

v0.03 (200510xx)
      - some public release
