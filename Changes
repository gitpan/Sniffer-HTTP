outstanding for 0.12:

Net::Pcap::FindDevice:
    - Spin off as a separate distribution
    
Sniffer::HTTP
    - implement multiple outstanding requests/responses for one connection

v0.11 (200511xx):
      - Refactored code out into Net::Pcap::FindDevice which 
        will soon begin a life of its own in a separate distribution
        (thanks to Bart Lateur and James Mastros)
      - You can specify a device by IP and not just by name or description.
        (suggested by Bart Lateur)
      - The live-capture test t/05 now has an alarm() to kill
        itself if it takes over 60 seconds.
 
v0.10 (20051106):
      - Staleness calbacks didn't work at all. Fixed now.

v0.09 (20051106):
      - added timeout to Sniffer::HTTP
      - added stale connection detection to Sniffer::HTTP
      - added last_activity to Sniffer::Connection
      - added timestamp handling from Net::Pcap so even
        captures play back with the correct timestamps
      - add "Tee to file" capability to ->run() under the
        option name "capture_file"

v0.08 (20051104):
      - Make magic less OS dependent:
        * qr// checks against keys and values, regardless of OS
      - guard against ->run(qr//), ->run(undef), ->run("") - these are
        handled gracefully
      - Make request absolute from Host: header
      - Reading from libpcap capture files works, even with filters
      - Add (example of) reading from an ethereal capture (see t/03*)
      - Fixed partially borked handling of Transfer-Encoding: chunked
      - Find and remember port number from TCP packets
          and put it in the request (faked via Host: header)

v0.07 (20051103)
      - Added Pcap example filters
      - added much more magic to select a suitable interface
        to listen on. See find_device().

v0.06 (200510xx)
      - Fixed crash if Sniffer::HTTP object is created without a log()
        callback.
      - The Pcap filter parameter was not used at all...

v0.05 (200510xx)
      - Added much documentation and clarifications thanks to (in no order)
         theorbtwo, blokhead, Bart Lateur,
      - Added live-http-headers.pl example script
      - Added methods to handle Ethernet and IP packets
      - Renamed handle_packet to handle_tcp_packet
      - handle_tcp_packet now accepts both, a raw TCP frame
        or a NetPacket::TCP hash
      - The demo script live-http-headers.pl has better/saner defaults
      - The test script dump-raw.pl has better/saner defaults
      - added simplicistic ->run method that tries to use sane defaults
      - Net::Pcap is now a prerequisite

v0.04 (200510xx)
      - Fixed the out-of-order TCP problem for now
      - added some first semblance of a test suite

v0.03 (200510xx)
      - some public release
